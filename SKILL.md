# Readymade Designation

A methodology for transformation through recontextualization rather than creation. The power lies not in making something new, but in pointing at something existing and declaring its new identity.

## When to Use
- When you need to challenge assumptions about what belongs in a category
- When the effort of creation would distract from the conceptual point
- When existing objects, ideas, or processes already contain what you need
- When you want to reveal that categories are social agreements, not inherent truths
- When "building from scratch" is actually the lazy path compared to radical selection



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Core Principle

**The choice is the creation.** Designation transforms objects not by changing their physical properties but by changing their frame of reference. A urinal in a plumbing store is a fixture; the same urinal in a gallery is a question.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify What Already Exists

Survey the landscape of existing objects, ideas, processes, or artifacts. What's already there that nobody is looking at properly? The readymade isn't about finding something beautiful or ugly—it's about finding something that becomes interesting when relocated.

Questions to ask:
- What objects are so common they've become invisible?
- What exists in one domain that would be shocking in another?
- What's been dismissed that deserves examination?

### Step 2: Select Based on Conceptual Resonance, Not Aesthetics

Choose your readymade based on "visual indifference" or its conceptual equivalent. The selection shouldn't be based on whether you like it. It should be based on what happens when you move it.

Criteria for selection:
- Does moving this object reveal something about its original context?
- Does moving this object reveal something about its new context?
- Is the selection surprising but defensible?

### Step 3: Perform the Act of Designation

Explicitly name what you've selected and claim it for its new category. This isn't subtle—it's a declaration. The power comes from the audacity of the claim, not from hiding what you're doing.

The designation formula:
- "This [existing thing] is now [new category]"
- Sign it, frame it, present it as the new thing
- Don't apologize or equivocate

### Step 4: Let the Context Do the Work

Once designated, step back. The tension between the object's origins and its new frame creates meaning automatically. You don't need to explain it to death. The readymade speaks through friction.

What happens next:
- The new context forces people to look at the object differently
- The object forces people to question the context
- Both are transformed by the encounter

### Step 5: Defend Through Indifference

When challenged, don't argue. The very fact that people are arguing proves the designation worked. If it didn't matter, no one would care. Their resistance is part of the work.

## Examples of Application

### In Business Strategy
Designate an existing internal process as an "external product." Don't build new software—take your internal tool and declare it a product. Slack, Basecamp, and countless others followed this pattern. The act of designation transforms the context.

### In Writing
Take found text—a spam email, a legal document, a user agreement—and designate it as poetry. Frame it, title it, present it in a literary context. The words don't change; everything else does.

### In Problem Solving
Instead of creating a new solution, designate an existing solution from another field. "This logistics algorithm is now a healthcare scheduling system." The readymade approach often reveals that your problem was already solved elsewhere.

### In Career Development
Designate your existing skills and experiences as qualifications for a role that traditionally requires different credentials. "My experience as a bartender is now customer experience expertise." The reframe changes what's possible.

### In Innovation
Find technology or methods that already exist in one industry and designate them for another. The "innovation" is often just the act of pointing and saying "this belongs here now."

## Key Principles

1. **Selection over creation** - Choosing well is harder and more powerful than making poorly
2. **Context is content** - The frame determines what the picture means
3. **Categories are conventions** - What "belongs" anywhere is a social agreement that can be renegotiated
4. **Audacity is required** - The designation must be bold enough to create friction
5. **The object talks back** - A good readymade transforms its new context as much as the context transforms it

## Common Mistakes

- **Over-explaining**: If you have to explain why it works, the selection was wrong
- **Aesthetic selection**: Choosing something because it's beautiful defeats the purpose
- **Timidity**: A weak designation doesn't create enough friction to be interesting
- **Ignoring context**: The new frame must be meaningfully different from the original

## The Deeper Point

The readymade methodology reveals that creation has always been mostly designation. Every artist, entrepreneur, or thinker is selecting from existing elements and claiming them for new purposes. The readymade just makes this visible. Once you see it, you can't unsee it—and you can use it deliberately.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

- input_data: [Specific example input]
- context: [Relevant background]
